# LC709203F LiPo Fuel Gauge #

The ON Semiconductor LC709203F Battery Fuel Gauge is an IC for monitoring the charge state of a single lithium ion cell. The IC communicates over an I2C bus and provides the battery's relative state-of-charge (RSOC) and voltage. The LC709203F can also determine battery temperature if an optional external thermistor is attached to the battery. It can also provide an alarm output signal if the battery charge or voltage is below a threshold set by the user.
